# Spam-Classification-Project

In this project I build a model for classifying the SMS/Email into spam or ham through the text of the SMS/Email using standard classifiers.I have used BAG OF WORDS in this project.  I have performed continuous integration and continuous deployment file . I have used FLASK application for  creating this  and I have deployed it over the Heroku platform




#REQUIREMENTS

Python
scikit-learn / sklearn
Pandas
NumPy
matplotlib
Docker
Flask
HEROKU


# COMPONENTS

Using BAG OF WORDS  for feature extraction of the text data for the messages.
Use splits for skewed data(Since the number of ham are far more than the number of spam messages,the data is skewed)
Use Train-test-split split for the split of skewed data.
Use different standard classifiers for classification of the SMS.
Compare the accuracy of various classifiers using standard classification metrics
Best Accuracy is given by RANDOM FOREST MODEL
